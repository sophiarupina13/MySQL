# MySQL
MFC application connecting to DB.

Files "demo.pdb" and "demo.pch" are not unloaded because of their big sizes.

The essence of the project is that the program displays tables from a local MySQL database. When you select the ID of a specific row of the table: 
  1. when you click RMB, a dialog box for deleting a row is displayed
  2. when you click LMB, a dialog box for adding a row is displayed
  3. when you click mouse wheel, a dialog box for editing a row is displayed
